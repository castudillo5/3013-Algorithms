### Conceptual Questions:

### 1.Define Hashing and Collision Resolution
### What is a hash table and why is collision resolution necessary?
### Explain the key differences between open hashing (chaining) and closed hashing (open addressing).

### 2.Collision Resolution Techniques

### Briefly describe at least two methods for resolving collisions in open addressing (e.g., linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing).
### Explain the pros and cons of each method.
### Which collision resolution technique can handle more values than table slots. Explain.
### What is the worst performance (big oh) for each type of collision resolution technique?

### 3.Impact of Hash Table Size

### How does the choice of table size affect the distribution of keys?
### What are the pitfalls of using a poor table size (for example, a table size that is a round number or a power of 2)?
